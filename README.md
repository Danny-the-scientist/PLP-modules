# PLP-modules
Pipeline Pilot module images utilized in LINCS and IDG work; NOT ACTUAL CODE

This contains images of the modular nature of Pipeline Pilot and some imaged samples of code, but not utilizable. Used primarily for ETL and curation tracking for [key entities and experiments](https://lincsproject.org/LINCS/data/standards)


Sharable LINCS Code/module use - as I mentioned before, LINCS primarily used a modular-based structure to obtain, edit, etc., various information. Some of it I can share, though out of context.

PLP enables use of global variables throughout the pipelines, referenced either with @ or $( .

Whatâ€™s coming in? - Find out if incoming csv submissions have already been seen, are mapped to proper values internally, and, if new or updated, get it completed:

Updating data for cells (astrocytes) - in order to properly curate the mass amount of data, new information being brought in needed to be organized and indicated for provenance purposes.
